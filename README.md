# 📝 Project Description

This project presents a comprehensive Global Space Exploration Analysis Dashboard built using Power BI, designed to provide deep, interactive, and visually intuitive insights into space missions conducted worldwide between 2000 and 2025. The dashboard enables users to explore how space exploration has evolved over time in terms of mission volume, budget allocation, technological adoption, success rates, and environmental impact.

The analysis goes beyond basic statistics by uncovering patterns across countries, mission types, propulsion technologies, and sustainability factors. Users can dynamically filter data using Year and Country slicers, allowing both high-level global analysis and detailed country-specific exploration. The dashboard is especially useful for students, researchers, and space enthusiasts who want to understand how modern space programs balance innovation, cost efficiency, and mission reliability.

By transforming raw mission data into meaningful visual insights, this project demonstrates the practical application of data visualization, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and DAX calculations to a real-world, technology-driven domain.

# 🎯 Key Insights

Global space exploration has shifted toward efficiency-driven missions rather than continuously increasing budgets.

Advanced technologies play a more critical role in mission success than financial investment alone.

Space exploration is no longer dominated by a few nations; emerging countries are increasingly contributing.

Environmental sustainability is becoming an important factor in mission planning.
